# TSP-Genetic_Algorithm
this is some code I wrote which solves a random instance of the travelling salesmen problem using a genetic algorithm.
the code then plots the best path and a graph showing how fitness improves over generations.
the user can feed in different parameters to the algorithm such as: number of cities, population size, number of generations, mutation rate and selection size.
